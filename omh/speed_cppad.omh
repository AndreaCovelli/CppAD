$section Routines That Speed Test CppAD$$

$head Purpose$$
CppAD has a set of speed tests that are used to determine if 
certain changes improve its execution speed
(and to compare CppAD with other AD packages).
This section explains how you can run these tests on your computer.

$head Windows$$
These routines have not been compiled or tested under Windows,
except for the case where one is using 
$href%
	http://www.cygwin.com%
	Cygwin
%$$
or,
$href%
	http://www.mingw.org%
	MinGW with MSYS
%$$.

$head Speed$$
To run these tests, you must include the
$code --with-Speed$$ command line option during the
$cref/install configure/InstallUnix/Configure/$$ command. 
You can then compile link and run the CppAD speed tests 
with the following commands (relative to the distribution directory):
$codep
	cd speed/cppad
	make 
	./run example
$$
This will check that the speed tests have been built correctly.
You can then run the command
$codep
	./run speed
$$
to see the results of the speed tests.
